## Business Background
As an international consumer finance provider, Home Credit offers affordable point-of-sale loan, cash loan and revolving loan product 
to its clients in 9 countries. With over 100M customers served under 434K distribution points, Home Credit strives to provide great and 
reliable financial services to its main customers, underserved borrowers with limited credit history.

## Our Task
Currently, Home Credit relies on applicants’ external credit history with statistical and machine learning methods to drive lending decisions. While existing model proves to be effective, Home Credit wants to further discover hidden traits in their data to unlock 
its full potential. With the combination of each consumer’s Credit Bureau and previous Home Credit application data, our team conducted 
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM to help the company develop an enhanced prediction model that would lead to more 
concise and intelligence conclusions. With the implementation of our prediction model, Home Credit can further expand financial inclusion
for the unbanked population and create a win-win situation for both parties.
